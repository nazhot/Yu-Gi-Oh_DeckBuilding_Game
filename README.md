# YuGiOh-DeckBuilding-Game
A new take on Yu-Gi-Oh deck building, adding the element of randomness, some skill, tough choices, and an opponent to deal with.

## Overview
A tool for adding another layer on top of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game! 2 players can go back and forth, getting random cards to compile their decks, with some interaction between opponents. This tool is meant to keep Yu-Gi-Oh fun by: taking a step back from the competitive side, generating decks more akin to playground-style duels, and turning deck building into an interactive game.

## Current Version
v0.0.4
- **Abilities Added**
  - Russian Roulette
    - "You're in a bind, you'll gain some rerolls, but at what cost?"
    - Gain 2 rerolls, but a random card of yours is rerolled
  - Long Term Success
    - "I knew intro to business would pay off!"
    - Costs 3 rerolls, get 6 rerolls in 5 turns
- Playing screen look fully updated
- Hovering over a card will show how many of that card are allowed per the ban list
- Log of your actions is shown as the game progresses
- You can click on a room name in order to join now
- Download screen removed, download button now appears at the bottom of the playing screen after last card drawn
- Deck breakdown information shown in the left panel (Card Type: current in deck / number allowed)
- Tool tip slowly fades in when an ability is hovered over
- Bug Fixes:
  - Attempting to make/join games after an opponent left your previous game caused multiple issues, now fixed
  - Players are able to see/reroll their last card
  
## Previous Versions
v0.0.3
- Added ability to host multiple games at once
  - Home screen is now the option to make or join a game
- Program resets all values/data when new game is created, which was the issue with v0.0.2
- Users can now put in a name to be displayed to them/their opponent

v0.0.2
- Reroll functionality added (last card drawn, only)
- Basic abilities have been added
  - Gain 2 rerolls, opponent gains 3
  - Gain the same card you last drew
  - Opponent gains the same card you last drew
- Able to select how many of trap/spell/monster cards will be going in both decks
  - Currently just a player 1 setting that is mirrored for both players
- Able to select amount of randomness when drawing new cards
  - Web scraped https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/deck_search.action?request_locale=en for decks, and the cards that make them up
  - Using these decks, made a connections matrix that shows how often card X is in the same deck as card Y
  - Also made a matrix for how many times cards appeared in decks, total
  - Values in the connections matrix are used as weights for a random draw, and the randomness factor has the weights go from all equal (random factor of 1) to fully based on values (random factor of 0)
- At the end of the game, both players are able to download their ydk file to be used in a duel online

v0.0.1
- Ugly as can be
- Two users can connect to the server, and ready/unready up
- Player 1 can set Card / Ban list, from the pre-determined list hosted on server
- When both are ready, player 1 can start game
- During game, players can go back and forth drawing 1 random card at a time
  - Card is completely random at the moment
  - Other player only sees that you drew a card, not what card it was
 - Viewers are allowed
  - See both players full decks, prone to cheating if you are a dishonest cotton headed mini muffin

## Hopeful Features
- Less ugly
- Have username information stored for repeated connecting
- Global settings for player 1 to set
  - Set List (cards that are auto-given to both players before game starts)
- Ability for players to upload their own card/ban/set list for use
